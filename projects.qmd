## Autism Cause Beliefs Survey Analysis

This project analyzes survey data to examine public beliefs about the causes of autism, including genetic factors, environmental exposure, vaccines, and prenatal brain development. The analysis explores demographic differences and relationships between beliefs using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. The goal of the project is to understand how scientific literacy and demographic characteristics shape perceptions of autism causation.
