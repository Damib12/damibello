## Goals

My goal is to build a career as a healthcare data analyst by developing strong skills in data analytics and data-driven storytelling. I am particularly interested in using data visualization and interactive dashboards to translate complex healthcare data into actionable insights that support clinical decision-making, operational efficiency, and improved patient outcomes. I aim to apply analytical techniques to real-world healthcare data sets to help organizations make informed, evidence-based decisions.

## Education

I am currently a graduate student in the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science (DACSS) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with an expected graduation date of February 2026. My coursework focuses on data analysis, data visualization, and data-driven storytelling, with an emphasis on applying analytical methods to real-world problems. Through this program, I am developing the technical and analytical skills needed to pursue a career as a healthcare data analyst, including interpreting complex datasets and communicating insights to diverse audiences.

## Experience

I have experience working in the Sales department at eternalHealth, a Medicare Advantage health plan, where I supported business operations in a start up healthcare environment. In this role, I worked with sales and performance data to support reporting, track metrics, and inform decision-making related to growth and outreach efforts. This position provided valuable exposure to how data is used across healthcare organizations to evaluate performance, support strategic initiatives, and align sales activities with regulatory and operational goals. The experience strengthened my interest in transitioning into a healthcare data analyst role focused on leveraging data to improve organizational outcomes and patient care.
